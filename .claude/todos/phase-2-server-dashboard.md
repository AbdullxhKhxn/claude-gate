# Task: Create interactive server monitoring dashboard

## Findings & Research

### TUI Dashboard Libraries Research
From WebSearch "golang terminal dashboard TUI real-time monitoring 2025":
- **termui**: Cross-platform dashboard library, good for widgets
- **tview**: Used by K9s, good documentation, pre-built components
- **Bubble Tea**: Modern TUI with Model-Update-View architecture (already using)
- **termdash**: Terminal dashboard based on termbox-go

### Real-Time Monitoring Best Practices
- Use goroutines for data collection
- Implement buffered channels for updates
- Limit refresh rates to prevent CPU usage
- Provide pause/resume functionality
- Support different view modes

### Dashboard Components Needed
1. Header with server status
2. Request statistics panel
3. Live request log with filtering
4. Resource usage graphs
5. Token status indicator
6. Keyboard shortcuts help

## Test Strategy

- **Test Framework**: Go's built-in testing with testify
- **Test Types**: 
  - Unit tests for dashboard components
  - Integration tests for real-time updates
  - Mock proxy server for testing
- **Coverage Target**: 80% for dashboard components
- **Edge Cases**:
  - High request volume
  - Network disconnections
  - Terminal resize
  - Keyboard navigation

## Test Cases

```go
// Test 1: Dashboard initialization
// Input: Dashboard model
// Expected: All components initialize correctly

// Test 2: Real-time statistics update
// Input: Request events
// Expected: Stats update without blocking

// Test 3: Request log filtering
// Input: Filter criteria
// Expected: Only matching requests shown

// Test 4: Terminal resize handling
// Input: Window size change
// Expected: Layout adjusts gracefully
```

## Maintainability Analysis

- **Readability**: [9/10] Bubble Tea MUV pattern is clear
- **Complexity**: Moderate - real-time updates add complexity
- **Modularity**: Each panel is a separate component
- **Testability**: Can mock data sources easily
- **Trade-offs**: Memory usage for request history

## Implementation Plan

1. Create dashboard model with sub-components
2. Implement statistics collector
3. Add request logging with ring buffer
4. Create keyboard navigation
5. Add filtering and search
6. Implement resource monitoring
7. Add export functionality
8. Write tests

## What Was Implemented

Created a real-time server monitoring dashboard with:
- Live request statistics (total, success rate, avg response time, req/sec)
- Scrollable request log with color-coded status
- Server status header with uptime
- Keyboard controls (q: quit, p: pause, c: clear, ?: help)
- Request event middleware that captures all proxy requests
- Ring buffer for efficient request history (1000 items max)
- Responsive layout with viewport for request log

## Working Scratchpad

### Requirements
- Real-time request monitoring
- Statistics aggregation
- Resource usage tracking
- Keyboard-driven interface
- Export capabilities

### Architecture
```
Dashboard
├── Header (status, uptime)
├── Stats Panel (req/sec, totals)
├── Request Log (scrollable, filterable)
├── Resource Panel (CPU, memory)
└── Help Footer (shortcuts)
```

### Data Flow
1. Proxy emits request events
2. Dashboard subscribes to events
3. Statistics aggregator updates
4. UI refreshes at controlled rate
5. User can pause/filter/export

### Code Structure
```go
type DashboardModel struct {
    stats      StatsModel
    requests   RequestLogModel
    resources  ResourceModel
    filter     FilterModel
    paused     bool
}
```

### Notes
- Use ring buffer for request history (limit 1000)
- Update UI max 10 times per second
- Aggregate stats per second/minute/hour
- Support CSV export of stats

### Commands & Output
```bash
# No additional dependencies needed
# Using existing Bubble Tea framework
```
