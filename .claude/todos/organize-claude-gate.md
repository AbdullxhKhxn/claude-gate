# Task: Organize Claude Gate Project Based on Best Practices

## Findings & Research

### WebSearch Results

#### 1. Go Project Structure Best Practices (2025)
- The `/cmd`, `/internal`, `/pkg` structure is popular but not mandatory
- `/internal` enforced by Go compiler for private packages
- `/pkg` for public/reusable code (controversial in Go community)
- Modern Go modules reduce need for complex structures
- Key principle: avoid over-structuring small projects

#### 2. OAuth Proxy Security Best Practices
- Store tokens securely (encrypted at rest)
- Use OS keychains when available
- Implement rate limiting with token bucket algorithm
- Token lifecycle management crucial
- Proactive security management and token revocation
- Never store credentials in plain text

#### 3. CLI Distribution Best Practices
- GoReleaser is the de facto standard for Go releases
- Multiple distribution channels recommended:
  - Direct binaries via GitHub releases
  - Homebrew for macOS/Linux
  - NPM for JavaScript ecosystem
  - Docker for containerized deployments
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions standard
- Cross-compilation with CGO_ENABLED=0 for portability

#### 4. HTTP Proxy Middleware Patterns
- SSE requires special handling (FlushInterval configuration)
- Three approaches for request transformation:
  - Override Director function
  - Chain Director functions
  - Wrap ServeHTTP in middleware
- Context propagation and graceful shutdown important
- httputil.ReverseProxy has known SSE latency issues

### Project Analysis

#### Current Structure
- Well-organized with clear separation of concerns
- Good use of internal packages for private code
- Empty directories suggest incomplete refactoring
- Version management needs centralization
- Test coverage exists but gaps in integration testing

#### Security Status
- OAuth PKCE implementation present
- Token storage currently file-based (needs keychain)
- Public client ID correctly used with PKCE
- Missing rate limiting
- No token encryption for file fallback

#### Distribution Status
- GoReleaser configuration complete
- NPM packages structured well
- GitHub Actions CI/CD in place
- Missing Homebrew formula
- Docker image not implemented

## Test Strategy

- **Test Framework**: Go standard testing + testify/assert
- **Test Types**: Unit (existing), Integration (needed), E2E (needed)
- **Coverage Target**: 80%+ for core packages
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - Token expiration/refresh
  - Concurrent requests
  - SSE streaming interruption
  - OAuth error flows

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Security & Testing (Current)
1. [✓] Clean up empty directories
2. [✓] Create .claude structure for task tracking
3. [✓] Document architecture decisions
4. [ ] Implement keychain integration
5. [ ] Add integration tests with mock server
6. [ ] Add rate limiting
7. [ ] Encrypt file-based token storage

### Phase 2: Documentation & Structure
1. [✓] Create ARCHITECTURE.md
2. [✓] Create SECURITY.md
3. [✓] Create CONTRIBUTING.md
4. [ ] Add architecture diagrams
5. [ ] Move CLI logic to internal/cli
6. [ ] Centralize version management

### Phase 3: Distribution
1. [ ] Create Homebrew formula
2. [ ] Create Docker image
3. [ ] Add TypeScript definitions to NPM
4. [ ] Implement download progress bars
5. [ ] Add binary integrity checks

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Polish
1. [ ] Add metrics endpoint
2. [ ] Implement structured logging
3. [ ] Add performance benchmarks
4. [ ] Create load tests
5. [ ] Finalize all documentation

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Keep Current Structure
- The existing `/cmd`, `/internal` structure is appropriate
- No need to add `/pkg` unless public API emerges
- Remove empty directories to reduce confusion

### 2. Security First Approach
- Keychain integration is highest priority
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Token encryption for defense in depth

### 3. Testing Strategy
- Integration tests with mock Anthropic server
- E2E tests for complete flows
- Security-focused test scenarios

### 4. Distribution Channels
- Keep existing GitHub/NPM channels
- Add Homebrew for better macOS/Linux UX
- Docker for enterprise deployments

## Commands & Output

```bash
# Created directory structure
mkdir -p .claude/todos .claude/archive .claude/knowledge docs/architecture docs/api docs/decisions

# Will clean empty directories
rm -rf internal/cli pkg/models  # After confirmation
```

## Notes

- Project is well-engineered with good practices already in place
- Main improvements are in security (keychain) and testing (integration)
- Distribution strategy is solid, just needs expansion
- Documentation needs formalization but code is well-commented
