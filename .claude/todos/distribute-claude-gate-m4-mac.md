# Task: Prepare claude-gate CLI for distribution to M4 Mac user

## Findings & Research

### Project Architecture Analysis
- Go CLI application using OAuth proxy for Claude API
- Go version: 1.24.4
- Binary location: /claude-gate (ARM64 native)
- Build system: GoReleaser with Makefile
- Package managers: NPM support included

### M4 Mac Compatibility Research
- M4 Macs use ARM64 architecture (same as M1/M2/M3)
- Current binary already compiled for darwin/arm64
- No CGO dependencies (CGO_ENABLED=0)
- Go has native Apple Silicon support

### Distribution Methods Available
1. Direct binary transfer
2. GoReleaser snapshot builds
3. NPM package distribution
4. GitHub releases
5. Potential Homebrew tap

### Security Considerations
- macOS Gatekeeper will block unsigned binaries
- Need to bypass with: xattr -d com.apple.quarantine claude-gate
- Code signing not currently implemented
- Notarization would provide seamless experience

## Test Strategy

- **Test Framework**: Manual testing + bash scripts
- **Test Types**: Build verification, installation testing
- **Coverage Target**: All distribution methods
- **Edge Cases**: Gatekeeper warnings, permission issues

## Test Cases

```bash
# Test 1: Binary architecture verification
# Input: file claude-gate
# Expected: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64

# Test 2: Clean build process
# Input: make clean && make build
# Expected: Successful build, new binary created

# Test 3: Binary execution on M4
# Input: ./claude-gate --version
# Expected: Version output without errors

# Test 4: Gatekeeper bypass
# Input: xattr -d com.apple.quarantine claude-gate
# Expected: Binary runs without security popup
```

## Maintainability Analysis

- **Readability**: [9/10] Clear Makefile, good documentation
- **Complexity**: Simple build process, single binary output
- **Modularity**: Well-organized with proper dependency management
- **Testability**: Easy to verify builds and distribution
- **Trade-offs**: Security vs ease of distribution

## Test Results Log

```bash
# Binary architecture verification
[2025-06-24 15:44:30] file claude-gate
Result: claude-gate: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64 ✅

# Clean build process
[2025-06-24 15:44:45] make clean && make build
Result: Build successful, binary created ✅

# Binary execution test
[2025-06-24 15:45:00] ./claude-gate version
Result: Version 0.1.0 displayed correctly ✅

# Distribution package creation
[2025-06-24 15:45:30] Created dist/claude-gate-m4-mac.tar.gz (3.6MB) ✅
```

## Checklist

- [✓] Analyze current build configuration
- [✓] Verify M4 Mac compatibility
- [✓] Create clean build
- [✓] Test binary locally
- [✓] Create distribution package
- [✓] Write installation instructions
- [✓] Test Gatekeeper bypass command
- [✓] Document distribution process

## Working Scratchpad

### Requirements
- Distribute claude-gate CLI to M4 Mac user
- Ensure easy installation and setup
- Handle macOS security restrictions
- Provide clear instructions

### Approach
1. Use existing ARM64 binary (already compatible)
2. Create distribution archive with docs
3. Provide Gatekeeper bypass instructions
4. Consider snapshot release for professional packaging

### Distribution Options Comparison

**Option 1: Direct Binary (Immediate)**
- Pros: Quick, no dependencies
- Cons: Security warnings, manual setup

**Option 2: GoReleaser Snapshot**
- Pros: Professional packaging, multi-platform
- Cons: Requires GoReleaser

**Option 3: NPM Package**
- Pros: Familiar install process
- Cons: Requires NPM setup

### Commands & Output

```bash
# Check current binary architecture
file claude-gate

# Build commands
make clean
make build

# Create distribution
make snapshot

# Gatekeeper bypass
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine claude-gate
```

### Notes
- M4 Mac uses same ARM64 architecture as M1/M2/M3
- Current project setup is fully compatible
- Main challenge is macOS security (Gatekeeper)
