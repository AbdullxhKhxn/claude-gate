# Task: Implement Platform-Native Token Storage with 99designs/keyring

## Findings & Research

### WebSearch Results

**Query: "golang keychain keystore cross-platform secure storage 2025"**
- 99designs/keyring identified as best cross-platform solution
- Supports macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service, KWallet
- Better backend support than zalando/go-keyring
- Active maintenance and flexible configuration

**Query: "golang secure token storage best practices OAuth 2025"**
- Always encrypt tokens at rest
- Use platform-native secure storage (Keychain/Keystore)
- Implement short-lived tokens with refresh
- Never store in plaintext or logs
- Use hardware-backed security when available

**Query: "99designs keyring golang implementation example 2025"**
- Uniform API across all platforms
- Built-in FileBackend with encryption as fallback
- JOSE encryption (PBES2_HS256_A128KW + A256GCM)
- Configurable password prompts for FileBackend

### Current Implementation Analysis

**File: internal/auth/storage.go**
- Currently stores tokens as JSON in ~/.claude-gate/auth.json
- File permissions 0600 (user read/write only)
- No encryption at rest
- TokenStorage struct with mutex for thread safety

**Security Documentation Review**
- OS keychain integration already planned in security roadmap
- Listed as Q1 2025 priority
- Mentions macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service, Windows Credential Manager

## Test Strategy

- **Test Framework**: Go testing with testify (already in use)
- **Test Types**: Unit, Integration, Platform-specific, Migration
- **Coverage Target**: 90% for storage package
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - Locked keychain scenarios
  - Backend unavailable
  - Migration failures
  - Concurrent access
  - Corruption recovery

## Test Cases

```go
// Test 1: Keyring storage basic operations
// Input: Token with OAuth data
// Expected: Successfully store and retrieve from keyring

// Test 2: Fallback to file when keyring unavailable
// Input: Mock keyring failure
// Expected: Automatic fallback to encrypted file storage

// Test 3: Migration from JSON to keyring
// Input: Existing JSON tokens
// Expected: All tokens migrated without data loss

// Test 4: Handle locked keychain
// Input: Locked keychain state
// Expected: Prompt for unlock, queue operations

// Test 5: Concurrent access safety
// Input: Multiple goroutines accessing storage
// Expected: No race conditions or data corruption
```

## Maintainability Analysis

- **Readability**: [9/10] Clean interface design, clear separation of concerns
- **Complexity**: Factory pattern keeps complexity manageable
- **Modularity**: Separate backends with common interface
- **Testability**: Mock keyring support, dependency injection ready
- **Trade-offs**: Additional dependency, but significant security gain

- [x] Backward compatibility tests

## Working Scratchpad

### Requirements
1. Seamless integration with OS keychains
2. Automatic fallback to encrypted file storage
3. Zero-downtime migration from existing JSON
4. Clear error messages for locked keychains
5. Maintain backward compatibility

### Approach
Phase 1: Foundation - Create interfaces and basic structure
Phase 2: Keyring Integration - Implement keyring backend
Phase 3: Migration System - Safe migration tools
Phase 4: User Experience - CLI commands and diagnostics
Phase 5: Testing - Comprehensive test coverage
Phase 6: Performance & Security - Optimization and hardening

### Code

```go
// StorageBackend interface
type StorageBackend interface {
    Get(provider string) (*TokenInfo, error)
    Set(provider string, token *TokenInfo) error
    Remove(provider string) error
    IsAvailable() bool
    RequiresUnlock() bool
}

// KeyringStorage implementation
type KeyringStorage struct {
    keyring keyring.Keyring
    config  KeyringConfig
    logger  Logger
}
```

### Notes
- Need to handle password prompts gracefully in non-interactive mode
- Consider caching for performance (with appropriate TTL)
- Must test on all three major platforms
- FileBackend uses JOSE encryption - secure fallback

### Commands & Output

```bash
# Add dependency
go get github.com/99designs/keyring

# Run tests
go test -v ./internal/auth/...
```
