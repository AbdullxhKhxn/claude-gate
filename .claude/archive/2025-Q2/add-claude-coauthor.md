# Task: Add Claude as co-author to 6 recent commits

## Findings & Research

Identified 6 commits missing Claude co-author attribution:
1. 5e9b089 - refactor: Update GitHub username to ml0-1337 and default port to 5789
2. 1236033 - chore: Remove binary from version control
3. 91e13a0 - fix: Fix dashboard requests/sec metric showing 0.0
4. 90e0d7f - feat: Add interactive server monitoring dashboard
5. e479f8e - feat: Enhance OAuth flow with interactive TUI and browser automation
6. 85e112d - feat: Add Bubble Tea UI foundation with enhanced CLI experience

From WebSearch results:
- Use interactive rebase with `reword` option
- Add co-author trailer with blank line before it
- Format: Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
- Will need force push since commits are already remote

## Working Scratchpad

### Requirements

Add Claude as co-author to recent commits that are missing this attribution.

### Approach

Use git rebase -i HEAD~10 to reword commit messages and add co-author.

### Code

N/A

### Notes

Co-author format to add:
```
ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### Commands & Output

```bash
# Created and ran script to add co-authors
./add-claude-coauthor.sh

# Successfully added co-authors to all commits using git filter-branch
# Verified with:
git log --format="%h %s" --grep="Co-Authored-By" -10

# All recent commits now have:
# ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
# Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>

# Created reusable script for future use at:
.claude/scripts/add-claude-coauthor.sh
```

### Safe Approach Plan

1. Create backup branch first
2. Use interactive rebase with exec commands for specific commits
3. Preserve all commit metadata except adding co-author
4. Force push with lease for safety
