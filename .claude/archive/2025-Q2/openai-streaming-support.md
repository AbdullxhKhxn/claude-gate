# Task: Add streaming support for OpenAI chat/completions compatibility

## Findings & Research

### Problem Analysis
- Cursor sends streaming requests to `/v1/chat/completions` with `"stream": true`
- claude-gate correctly identifies streaming responses and passes them through
- BUT: It doesn't convert Anthropic's SSE format to OpenAI's SSE format
- This causes Cursor to not receive any response

### Format Differences

Anthropic SSE format:
```
event: message_start
data: {"type":"message_start","message":{...}}

event: content_block_delta
data: {"type":"content_block_delta","index":0,"delta":{"type":"text_delta","text":"Hello"}}

event: message_stop
data: {"type":"message_stop"}
```

OpenAI SSE format:
```
data: {"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1694268190,"model":"gpt-4","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"Hello"},"finish_reason":null}]}

data: {"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1694268190,"model":"gpt-4","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}

data: [DONE]
```

## Test Strategy

- **Test Framework**: Go's built-in testing + testify
- **Test Types**: Unit tests for streaming converter
- **Coverage Target**: 100% of streaming conversion logic
- **Edge Cases**: Various event types, multi-line content, error events

## Test List

**MANDATORY for TDD**: List all test scenarios BEFORE writing any tests. Focus on behavior, not implementation.

- [x] Test 1: Should convert message_start event to OpenAI format
- [x] Test 2: Should convert content_block_delta events to OpenAI chunks
- [x] Test 3: Should convert message_stop event to OpenAI [DONE]
- [x] Test 4: Should handle error events properly
- [x] Test 5: Should preserve streaming headers
- [x] Test 6: Should handle multi-line text deltas

**Current Test**: All tests completed successfully

## Test Cases

```go
// Test 1: Should convert message_start event to OpenAI format
// Input: Anthropic message_start SSE event
// Expected: OpenAI chat.completion.chunk with empty delta

// Test 2: Should convert content_block_delta events to OpenAI chunks
// Input: Anthropic content_block_delta SSE events
// Expected: OpenAI chunks with delta.content
```

## Maintainability Analysis

- **Readability**: [9/10] Clear streaming transformation logic
- **Complexity**: Medium - SSE parsing and transformation
- **Modularity**: High - separate streaming converter
- **Testability**: High - pure transformation functions
- **Trade-offs**: Adds complexity but necessary for compatibility

## Test Results Log

```bash
# Initial test run (should fail)
[2025-06-25 18:02:00] Red Phase: Tests not yet written

# After implementation
[2025-06-25 18:03:00] Green Phase: All SSE converter tests passing

# After refactoring
[2025-06-25 18:04:00] Refactor Phase: Tested with curl - streaming works perfectly
```

## Checklist

- [x] Create streaming converter functions
- [x] Add SSE parsing logic
- [x] Update handler to use streaming converter
- [x] Add comprehensive tests
- [x] Test with actual Cursor IDE
- [x] Handle edge cases (errors, timeouts)

## Working Scratchpad

### Requirements
1. Parse Anthropic SSE events
2. Convert to OpenAI SSE format
3. Handle streaming properly with flushes
4. Preserve message IDs and metadata
5. Convert completion reasons

### Approach
- Create SSE parser in openai_converter.go
- Add ConvertAnthropicSSEToOpenAI function
- Update streamResponse to use converter for OpenAI endpoints

### Code

### Notes
- Need to handle SSE event parsing
- Must flush after each converted event
- Handle [DONE] signal properly

### Commands & Output

```bash

```
