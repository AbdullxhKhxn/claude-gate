# Task: Update CLAUDE.md with detailed project directory structure information

## Findings & Research

### Current CLAUDE.md Analysis
The current CLAUDE.md has good architectural information but lacks detailed directory structure. It mentions components but doesn't show the complete project layout, making it harder for Claude to navigate the codebase efficiently.

### Web Search Findings
Best practices for Claude Code project documentation include:
1. **Context Management**: Clear project structure helps preserve context
2. **Project Organization**: Directory trees and file locations improve navigation
3. **Quick Reference**: Common file paths for frequent access
4. **Claude Projects Feature**: Can handle up to 200K tokens of context

### Directory Structure
```
claude-gate/
├── cmd/claude-gate/          # CLI application
├── internal/                 # Private packages
│   ├── auth/                # Authentication
│   ├── config/              # Configuration
│   ├── proxy/               # Proxy server
│   ├── test/                # Test infrastructure
│   └── ui/                  # Terminal UI
├── docs/                    # Documentation
├── npm/                     # NPM distribution
├── scripts/                 # Utility scripts
└── .claude/                 # Claude-specific
```

## Test Strategy

- **Test Framework**: N/A (documentation change)
- **Test Types**: Manual verification of improved Claude navigation
- **Coverage Target**: All major directories documented
- **Edge Cases**: Ensure no paths become outdated

## Test Cases

```bash
# Verify documentation accuracy
# 1. Check all paths exist
# 2. Verify descriptions match actual content
# 3. Test Claude's ability to navigate with new info
```

## Maintainability Analysis

- **Readability**: [10/10] Clear structure improves understanding
- **Complexity**: Simple markdown additions
- **Modularity**: Well-organized sections
- **Testability**: Can verify paths programmatically
- **Trade-offs**: Need to keep updated as project evolves

## Test Results Log

```bash
# Documentation update - no automated tests
[2025-06-24 20:51:22] Implementation Phase: Adding directory structure to CLAUDE.md
```

## Checklist

- [x] Analyze current CLAUDE.md structure
- [x] Research best practices for project documentation
- [x] Map complete directory structure
- [x] Add Project Structure section
- [x] Add Quick Navigation section
- [x] Update existing paths to be more specific
- [x] Verify all paths are correct
- [x] Commit changes

## Working Scratchpad

### Requirements
- Add comprehensive directory structure
- Include file naming conventions
- Provide quick navigation paths
- Explain purpose of each directory

### Approach
1. Insert new "Project Structure" section after "Architecture"
2. Add "Quick Navigation" section before "Common Commands"
3. Use tree format for visual clarity
4. Include key file locations

### Code

New sections to add:
1. Project Structure (detailed tree + explanations)
2. Quick Navigation (common paths)

### Notes
- Keep structure updated as project evolves
- Consider adding this to release checklist

### Commands & Output

```bash

```
