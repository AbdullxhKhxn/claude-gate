# Task: Fix go.mod version format to resolve GitHub Actions test failure

## Findings & Research

The GitHub Actions test failure at https://github.com/ml0-1337/claude-gate/actions/runs/15867418969/job/44736843808 shows that the "Test GoReleaser Config" job is failing.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. The go.mod file currently specifies `go 1.24.4` (line 3)
2. Go modules expect the format to be `go 1.24` without patch version
3. This causes an error: "invalid go version '1.24.4': must match format 1.24"

### WebSearch Findings
- Go module specification doesn't support patch versions in the `go` directive
- The format should be `go 1.x` not `go 1.x.x`
- Running `go mod tidy` will automatically fix this format issue
- This is a common issue when manually editing go.mod files

## Test Strategy

This is a configuration fix that doesn't require unit tests, but we'll verify:
- The go.mod file is valid after the change
- GoReleaser can parse the configuration
- The project builds successfully

## Implementation

Change line 3 in go.mod from `go 1.24.4` to `go 1.24`

## Checklist

- [x] Identify the issue in go.mod
- [x] Update go.mod to use correct version format
- [x] Run `go mod tidy` to validate
- [x] Test GoReleaser locally with `goreleaser check`
- [x] Verify project builds successfully
- [x] Commit the fix

## Working Scratchpad

### Requirements
Fix the go.mod version format to resolve GitHub Actions test failures

### Approach
Simple one-line change to remove the patch version from the go directive

### Commands & Output

```bash
# Fixed go.mod content (line 3):
go 1.24

# Validation results:
$ go mod tidy
# Success - also updated keyring dependency

$ goreleaser check
  • checking                                         path=.goreleaser.yml
  • 1 configuration file(s) validated
  • thanks for using GoReleaser!

$ go build -v ./cmd/claude-gate
# Success - project builds without errors
```
