# Task: Fix GitHub Actions failures by removing Windows references from scripts and tests

## Findings & Research

The GitHub Actions are failing due to remnants of Windows support that was previously removed from the codebase. The failures are:

1. **Test Scripts (ubuntu-latest)** - Failed with:
   ```
   sed: can't read npm/platforms/win32-x64/package.json: No such file or directory
   Error: Process completed with exit code 2.
   ```

2. **Test GoReleaser Config** - Failed after checking for Windows binary that doesn't exist

### Root Causes Identified:

1. **scripts/update-version.sh**:
   - Lines 40, 47: Updates reference to `@claude-gate/win32-x64` in npm/package.json
   - Line 51: Loop includes "win32-x64" platform

2. **.github/workflows/test.yml**:
   - Line 116: Checks for Windows binary: `test -f dist/claude-gate_*_windows_amd64*/claude-gate.exe`

3. **scripts/test-all.sh**:
   - Line 197: Lists "win32-x64" as expected platform
   - Lines 286-292: Tries to validate win32-x64 package.json

4. **.goreleaser.yml**:
   - Only builds for darwin and linux (no Windows)
   - But line 56 has format override for Windows (unused)

## Test Strategy

- **Test Framework**: GitHub Actions workflows
- **Test Types**: Integration tests via CI/CD
- **Coverage Target**: All scripts execute without errors
- **Edge Cases**: Platform detection on different OS

## Test Cases

```bash
# Test 1: Update version script runs without errors
./scripts/update-version.sh 9.9.9
# Expected: No errors, only darwin and linux platforms updated

# Test 2: GoReleaser test passes
goreleaser build --snapshot --clean
ls dist/
# Expected: Only darwin and linux binaries present

# Test 3: NPM package structure test passes
./scripts/test-all.sh
# Expected: No failures for missing Windows packages
```

## Maintainability Analysis

- **Readability**: [8/10] Clear what platforms are supported
- **Complexity**: Low - simple removal of unsupported platform
- **Modularity**: Good - platform list centralized in most places
- **Testability**: High - CI/CD tests will validate
- **Trade-offs**: None - Windows was already removed from support

## Test Results Log

```bash
# Test 1: Update version script - PASSED
[2025-06-25 13:14:12] ./scripts/update-version.sh 9.9.9
✅ Version updated to 9.9.9 in all files!
No errors, only updated darwin and linux platforms

# Test 2: GoReleaser config validation - PASSED
[2025-06-25 13:15:03] goreleaser check
✓ 1 configuration file(s) validated

# Test 3: NPM package structure test - PASSED
[2025-06-25 13:15:45] Ran test_npm_package_structure
✓ All platform packages validated (darwin-x64, darwin-arm64, linux-x64, linux-arm64)
✓ No Windows package checks performed
```

## Checklist

- [x] Remove Windows references from scripts/update-version.sh
- [x] Remove Windows binary check from .github/workflows/test.yml
- [x] Remove Windows from scripts/test-all.sh platforms array
- [x] Remove Windows format override from .goreleaser.yml
- [x] Check scripts/test-npm-local.sh for Windows references (already commented out)
- [x] Check scripts/build-release.sh for Windows references (only in grep pattern, no issue)
- [x] Run tests locally to verify fixes
- [x] Commit changes

## Working Scratchpad

### Requirements
- Remove all Windows/win32 references from build and test scripts
- Ensure CI/CD passes without Windows support
- Maintain support for darwin and linux platforms only

### Approach
1. Systematically remove Windows references from each file
2. Test each script locally where possible
3. Ensure consistency across all configuration files

### Code
[Will add diffs as I make changes]

### Notes
- GoReleaser config has Windows format override but doesn't build for Windows
- NPM packages only exist for darwin and linux platforms
- Need to be thorough to catch all references

### Commands & Output

```bash
